# EF Core SQL to Object Utility

Hello üñêÔ∏è 

Welcome to the EF Core SQL to Object Mapping Utility, a powerful tool designed to simplify the execution of raw SQL queries and the mapping of their results to strongly-typed .NET objects within an Entity Framework Core (EF Core) context. This utility enhances developer productivity by bridging the gap between the flexibility of SQL and the type safety of .NET, making data access more efficient and secure..


## Features üåü

- **Asynchronous Query Execution**: Perform SQL query and stored procedure executions directly from your `DbContext`.
- **Dynamic Parameterization**: Securely pass parameters to your queries and stored procedures to prevent SQL injection attacks.
-   **Automatic Result Mapping**: Easily map dynamic query results to strongly-typed objects or lists, leveraging the full capabilities of C# and .NET.



## Getting Started

Incorporate the `DbContextExtensions` and `ObjectMapper` into your project to start enhancing your EF Core operations. These components are crucial for extending your `DbContext` with powerful functionalities:

1.  **`DbContextExtensions`**: Provides methods for executing SQL commands, including queries and stored procedures, with support for asynchronous operations.
2.  **`ObjectMapper`**: Facilitates the conversion of dynamic results into strongly-typed entities using reflection.

 
### Quick Notes

-   **Parameter Matching**: Ensure dictionary keys for parameters match SQL query placeholders (without the `@` prefix).
-   **Testing Queries**: Always test SQL queries in a controlled environment before integration.
-   **SQL Syntax Awareness**: Pay attention to SQL syntax, including spaces and special characters, to avoid unexpected behavior.

**Parameters**:
-   `sqlQuery`: The SQL query string.
-   `parameters`: a dictionary of parameters to be passed to the SQL query.




### Example Implementations

Here's how you can leverage our utility in your projects:


#### 1. `SelectSqlQueryListAsync<T>`: Executes a SQL query asynchronously and maps the results to a list of strongly-typed objects. It's useful for queries expected to return multiple rows.

```csharp
var result= await context.SelectSqlQueryListAsync<ViewModel>(query, paramList);


```

#### 2.**`SelectSqlQueryFirstOrDefaultAsync<T>`**: Asynchronously executes a SQL query and maps the first result to a strongly-typed object. Ideal for queries where only a single result is expected.

```csharp
var result= await context.SelectSqlQueryFirstOrDefaultAsync<ViewModel>(query, paramList);


```

#### 3.**`ExecuteSqlQueryCommandAsync`**: Executes a SQL command (e.g., update, delete) asynchronously without returning any results. Useful for data manipulation operations.

```csharp
await context.ExecuteSqlQueryCommandAsync(query, updateParamList);


```


#### 4.**`SelectStoredProcedureListAsync<T>`**: Executes a stored procedure asynchronously, returning the results as a list of strongly-typed objects. Suitable for stored procedures expected to return multiple rows.

```csharp
var result= await context.SelectStoredProcedureListAsync<ViewModel>(sp_name, paramList);

```

#### 5.**`SelectStoredProcedureFirstOrDefaultAsync<T>`**: Executes a stored procedure and maps the first result to a strongly-typed object. Used when a stored procedure is expected to return a single row.

```csharp
var result= await context.SelectStoredProcedureFirstOrDefaultAsync<ViewModel>(sp_name, paramList);


```

#### 6.**`ExecuteStoredProcedureAsync`**: Executes a stored procedure without returning any results, typically used for operations like update or delete through stored procedures.

```csharp
await context.ExecuteStoredProcedureAsync(sp_name, paramList);
```


## Example: Fetching Books by Genre and Price Limit
### Scenario
You want to retrieve a list of books that belong to a specific tag, say "Computer Science", and are priced under $20. This example shows how to execute this query using `SelectSqlQueryListAsync<T>` and map the results to a list of `BookViewModel`.

```csharp
const string sqlQuery = @" SELECT Title, Author, Price 
			   FROM Books 
			   WHERE Tag= @tag AND Price < @priceLimit";
					
// Define parameters for the tag and price limit  
var parameters = new Dictionary<string, object> 
{ 
	{"tag", "Computer Science"}, 
	{"priceLimit", 20}
};


// Execute the query and map the results
var affordableComputerScienceBooks = await dbContext.SelectSqlQueryListAsync<BookViewModel>(
    sqlQuery, parameters);
```

### Key Points to Remember

-   **Parameter Alignment**: Make sure the keys in your parameters dictionary match the placeholders in your SQL query exactly. For example, `"tag"` corresponds to `@tag` in the SQL query.
    
-   **Preventing SQL Injection**: Using parameterized queries, as shown, helps prevent SQL injection by ensuring that user input or variable values cannot be used to alter the query's structure maliciously.
    
-   **Testing Your Queries**: Always test your queries with various input values to ensure they return the expected results. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and application reliability.
    
-   **Simplicity and Clarity**: When writing SQL queries, aim for simplicity and clarity. Ensure that your queries are easy to read and understand, which aids in maintenance and debugging.
